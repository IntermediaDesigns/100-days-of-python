  <h2>A Hangman Game by Lynjai Jimenez</h2>
  <p>This challenge is to create a Hangman game. The user guesses a letter that the game has randomly selected from an array. If the letter is in the word, the letter is displayed. If the letter is not in the word, the user loses a body part. The user has 6 body parts. If the user runs out of guesses, the game is over. If the user guesses the word before they run out of body parts, they win.
