  <h1>ðŸ‘¾ MokÃ©Beast - The Non-Copyright Generic Beast Battle Game ðŸ‘¾</h1>
  <h2>A MokeBeast Generator by Lynjai Jimenez</h2>
  <p>This challenge is all about using dictionaries to create a game about small creatures that you have captured, enslaved, and forced to fight for your amusement. You monster.
<br><br>
    This game works in a completely non-copyright and totally lawyer friendly way. Pika-who? I have absolutely no idea what you mean..... officer.
